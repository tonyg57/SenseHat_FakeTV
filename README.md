# SenseHat_FakeTV
Simulate a TV left on in the room on a Raspberry Pi and Sense Hat.

I came up with this program because I couldn't find anything like it that uses the SenseHat here on GitHub.
The program is designed to emulate the FakeTV hardware device as seen here: https://faketv.com/

I do place a faceted glass paperweight on top of the SenseHat to distribute the light.
Running the Raspberry Pi a few feet from a window with the blinds down gives the appearance from outside of a TV left on (i.e. somebody's home).

Feel free to tweak and optimize the code for your own use.

The code is certainly sloppy and I needed some help via ChatGPT because I don't natively speak Python.
